## ðŸ“š My FlexiQuiz Learning Series 

Welcome to my curated collection of quizzes hosted on [FlexiQuiz](https://www.flexiquiz.com). These assessments are designed to test and reinforce knowledge across a variety of technical domains including **the human centered design process**, **software testing**, **Java programming**, **cryptography**,  **software security**, and **algorithms + data structures**.

Each quiz has been crafted to balance core theory with real-world application and critical thinking. Many of them are content from subjects at NTNU Trondheim, several of them are old exams questions from previous exams.

## CPU-X and the human centered design process - TDT4180 ##

This quiz maps exactly to the CPUX-F (Foundation) / UXQB-F syllabus, covering all Foundation-level learning objectives:

*Fundamentals & Human-Centred Design*
â€“ Concepts of usability, UX and ISO 9241-210 process steps (planning, context-of-use, requirements, design, evaluation) 
uxqb.org

- *Context of Use & User Analysis*
â€“ Describing users, goals, tasks, environments; personas; user groups; stakeholders; as-is scenarios 
uxqb.org

- *Requirements Engineering*
â€“ From user needs to qualitative and quantitative user requirements; human-centred quality objectives 
tecnovy

- *Information Architecture & Interaction Design*
â€“ Navigation structures, dialogue principles (ISO 9241-110), mental models, design patterns, prototypes (low-/high-fidelity), storyboards, card sorting 
tecnovy

- *Usability Evaluation Methods*
â€“ Usability testing (planning, moderation, pre-/post-session interviews), heuristic inspections, surveys, contextual interviews, focus groups, observations; reporting findings 
tecnovy

- *UX Professional Roles & Process Integration*
â€“ Responsibilities in planning and managing a human-centred design project; creating deliverables; iterative refinement through usability evaluation 
uxqb.org

In other words, every question in this 40-item exam is drawn either from the public CPUX-F question set or directly from the official CPUX-F Curriculum & Glossary document, exactly as prescribed for TDT4180â€™s UXQB-F/CPUX-F module.
