## Algorithms and Data Structures - TDT4120

A comprehensive series covering secure development practices and application-level security.

- [Algorithms and Data Structures – Part 1](https://www.flexiquiz.com/SC/N/Algdat1)  
  The 25‑page quiz is a concise tour of first‑semester algorithmic thinking: it opens with complexity theory, spotlighting NP‑completeness and the domino effect of an efficient solution to any NP‑complete problem; then it revisits classic combinatorial challenges such as the Traveling‑Salesperson and shortest‑path problems while contrasting scenarios that demand exact answers with those where near‑optimal suffices, and highlights the difference between offline and online algorithm settings. Practical correctness proofs follow, using loop invariants on a simple SUM‑ARRAY routine, before turning to selection sort’s invariant, loop bound, and Θ‑time analysis, plus linear search’s average and worst cases and a thought experiment on forcing a “good” best case for any sort. Divide‑and‑conquer appears through a fill‑in‑the‑blank Master‑Theorem template and a Θ(n log n) two‑sum algorithm, and the quiz closes with ranking common growth rates, simplifying asymptotic expressions, and converting polynomials to tight Θ‑notation—together forming a compact checklist of essential algorithm‑analysis skills.

- [Algorithms and Data Structures – Part 2](https://www.flexiquiz.com/SC/N/Algdat2)  
  This quiz walks you through the entire “algorithms and data‑structures toolbox,” starting with the language of growth rates—matching expressions like lg n, √n, n log n, 2ⁿ, and n! to their names and interpreting Big‑O, Θ, Ω, o, and ω symbols—before testing your ability to classify real formulas and combine asymptotic bounds. It then shifts to practical algorithm analysis: you compare Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quicksort across best, average, and worst cases; dig into how the Relax (u, v, w) operation underpins Dijkstra’s and how Bellman‑Ford differs; and review Kruskal’s role in building minimum‑spanning trees. Advanced sections probe a proposed New‑SSSP method, examine why simply proving the greedy‑choice property isn’t enough, and ask you to debate pseudopolynomial versus NP‑hard claims around Ford‑Fulkerson and hyperflows. The final question highlights how choosing the right pivot can make or break Quicksort’s performance, tying algorithm theory back to implementation details.

- [Algorithms and Data Structures – Part 3](https://www.flexiquiz.com/SC/N/Algdat3)  
  The third quiz surveys intermediate‑level algorithmic design and analysis: it starts with the greedy‑choice property and when greedy methods work, then moves into data‑structure trade‑offs—evaluating selection sort enhanced with a binary‑search tree, comparing heaps, binary trees and self‑adjusting splay trees. Next comes optimization technique: why naïve recursion explodes, how memoization/dynamic programming rescues it, and what structural properties enable that speed‑up. A block of questions contrasts classic and randomized algorithms (Quicksort versus Randomized Quicksort, Select versus Randomized Select, and what happens when Select drives Quicksort) and checks understanding of insertion, merge, quick, randomized quick and heap sort behaviors. Complexity theory follows: identifying classes such as NP and NP‑complete and their verification versus solution difficulty. The quiz then tackles graph algorithms—minimum‑spanning trees (Prim vs Kruskal), the Ford‑Fulkerson max‑flow method and why its run‑time depends on capacity size—before revisiting the Master Theorem and finishing with maximum, average and best‑case bounds for heap sort. Overall, it presses students to connect algorithmic paradigms, data‑structure choices, and asymptotic reasoning across a spectrum of classic problems.

- [Algorithms and Data Structures – Part 4](https://www.flexiquiz.com/SC/N/Algdat4)  
  This fourth installment drills deep into asymptotic reasoning: you extend the classic crossing argument to derive an Ω(n²) lower bound for insertion sort when the α n largest keys start up front, figure out the α that maximizes crossings, and refine the necessary constraints on α. You then prove and debunk common Big‑O claims—why max{f,g}=Θ(f+g), why “at least O(n²)” is meaningless, and why no function can lie in both o(g) and ω(g). Quick‑fire questions test your ability to manipulate α‑weighted sums, spot when factorials of logarithms outgrow polynomials, and solve k log k = Θ(n). The quiz finishes with a flurry of Master‑Theorem puzzles: parsing parameters, selecting the right case, and tying a generic divide‑and‑conquer template back to Merge Sort. Together the problems weave concrete algorithm examples with rigorous asymptotic definitions, sharpening both proof technique and recurrence‑cracking speed.

- [Algorithms and Data Structures – Part 5](https://www.flexiquiz.com/SC/N/Algdat5)  
The fifth quiz zeroes in on asymptotic‑notation fluency: it asks you first to compare two exponential functions via their ratio, then to rank 12 standard growth rates from constant to super‑exponential, reinforcing intuitive speed ordering. Next, you must decide which Big‑Oh / little‑oh relations are obligatorily true, and twice choose the tightest asymptotic bound for composite expressions that mix Θ, O, o and Ω terms—one dominated by an n⁴ component plus lower‑order extras, the other by intertwined linear and quadratic terms. In short, every question tests your ability to recognize, rank and simplify time‑complexity expressions and to pick the most precise bound.
