## 📚 My FlexiQuiz Learning Series 

Welcome to my curated collection of quizzes hosted on [FlexiQuiz](https://www.flexiquiz.com). These assessments are designed to test and reinforce knowledge across a variety of technical domains including **the human centered design process**, **software testing**, **Java programming**, **cryptography**,  **software security**, and **algorithms + data structures**.

Each quiz has been crafted to balance core theory with real-world application and critical thinking. Many of them are content from subjects at NTNU Trondheim, several of them are old exams questions from previous exams.

## CPU-X and the human centered design process - TDT4180 ##

- [CPUX-F - Test 1](https://www.flexiquiz.com/Create/Edit/931d8306-10b2-424d-a52c-39c54c63d07f)
This quiz maps exactly to the CPUX-F (Foundation) / UXQB-F syllabus, covering all Foundation-level learning objectives:

*Fundamentals & Human-Centred Design*
– Concepts of usability, UX and ISO 9241-210 process steps (planning, context-of-use, requirements, design, evaluation) 
uxqb.org

- *Context of Use & User Analysis*
– Describing users, goals, tasks, environments; personas; user groups; stakeholders; as-is scenarios 
uxqb.org

- *Requirements Engineering*
– From user needs to qualitative and quantitative user requirements; human-centred quality objectives 
tecnovy

- *Information Architecture & Interaction Design*
– Navigation structures, dialogue principles (ISO 9241-110), mental models, design patterns, prototypes (low-/high-fidelity), storyboards, card sorting 
tecnovy

- *Usability Evaluation Methods*
– Usability testing (planning, moderation, pre-/post-session interviews), heuristic inspections, surveys, contextual interviews, focus groups, observations; reporting findings 
tecnovy

- *UX Professional Roles & Process Integration*
– Responsibilities in planning and managing a human-centred design project; creating deliverables; iterative refinement through usability evaluation 
uxqb.org

In other words, every question in this 40-item exam is drawn either from the public CPUX-F question set or directly from the official CPUX-F Curriculum & Glossary document, exactly as prescribed for TDT4180’s UXQB-F/CPUX-F module.

## Software Testing and Quality Series - TDT4242

A series focused on core software testing concepts, methodologies, and best practices.

TDT4242 - “Advanced Software Engineering” is a 7.5‑ECTS spring‑semester course at NTNU that deepens your ability to engineer smart, safety‑critical and otherwise complex software‑intensive systems. Delivered in English, it is organised into four interconnected modules - (1) requirements specification, where you learn to transform stakeholder wishes into precise, high‑quality technical requirements; (2) testing management, which surveys modern test‑planning and test‑automation strategies; (3) code‑quality improvement, covering static analysis, peer review and systematic refactoring; and (4) verification & validation of large‑scale or AI‑assisted systems. Weekly lectures are paired with mandatory exercises and a group project in which you practise requirements engineering, design targeted test suites, and refactor real code bases. By the end you should be able to diagnose requirement flaws, select and apply suitable test and code‑review techniques, and critically assess emerging AI‑supported development tools. The course assumes prior experience in web development and Python/JavaScript (e.g., TDT4140) and is assessed by a four‑hour written school exam (letter grading), with approved coursework as a prerequisite for sitting the exam,

## Algorithms and Data Structures - TDT4120

TDT4120 - “Algorithms and Data Structures” is a 7.5‑ECTS intermediate course at NTNU that runs every autumn and equips students to design, analyse and implement efficient algorithms. Lectures and compulsory exercises take you from asymptotic efficiency analysis and divide‑and‑conquer recursion through classic ordering, searching, sorting and hashing techniques, on to dynamic‑programming and greedy paradigms, advanced graph structures, shortest‑path, matching, spanning‑tree and maximum‑flow algorithms, and the fundamentals of complexity theory. By the end, you’re expected to recognise a broad repertoire of established algorithms, evaluate their time‑ and space‑costs, and craft new solutions when none exist—competence that underpins later AI, cyber‑security and systems courses. Instruction is Norwegian‑language, the set text is Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS 4ᵗʰ ed.), and assessment is a four‑hour written school exam.
